# User Experience - UX 

For those who is looking for a brief explanation of what is a food-based dietary guideline, the different approaches and countries that apply and promote it; this webpage will try to accomplish this desire.

- ## Design

  - ### Colour Scheme
    - The main background colour throughout the website is orange, while the font is white;
    - The background image is a wood table with a knife in the left and parsley in the top right;
    - There is a dark cover over the background image with 50% transparency, which provides a nice contrast to the white letters.
    
  - ### Typography
     - The entire website used only two fonts. The paragraphs use the Roboto Condensed letter, while the headings use Dosis. These two fonts were selected due to their attractive appearance which matches with the purpose of the website.
     
  - ### Imagery
     - The hero images are a carousel of images, which promptly grab the attention of the visitor. A mix of visual and taste senses, a text box was used with a brief legend of each image, with a link that directs the visitor to the exact fact information related to the image;
     - Secondary images are self-explained once they are directed related to each section and information are immediately provided.
     
  - ### Wireframe
     - The initial wireframe for this project can be found [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/c2c3b264-af21-44c6-5dfb-b53a205c43c1-b4f2/).
