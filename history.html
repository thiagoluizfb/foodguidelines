								At the beginning of the century, scientists managed to isolate the main components of 
                                food (Carbon, Nitrogen, Hydrogen, and Oxygen), which were connected to health. 
                                Justin Liebig, a German scientist, identified the chemical structure of carbohydrates, 
                                fats, and proteins.

									Christiaan Eijkman was working with natives of Java who had developed the disease beriberi. 
                                    Beriberi is a severe disease that causes heart disease and even paralysis.
								</p>

                                    Through his deduction, Eijkman discovered that changing the natives’ diet from white rice 
                                    to brown rice cured the beriberi. It was later discovered that the husk of the unprocessed 
                                    brown rice contained thiamine, or Vitamin B1.

                                The Sweden's National Board of Health and Welfare saw forced to develop the idea of 
                                "basic foods" that were both cheap and nutritious. This pressure was due  to the high food 
                                prices in the country back. The suggestion was a triangle in which the basic foods were at the base.

                                The idea was converted into the first food pyramid, which was introduced to the public in 1974. 
                                The pyramid was divided into basic foods at the base, including milk, cheese, margarine, bread, cereals and potato;

                                    The food-based dietary guidelines started being adopted by several countries. Around 70 nations had their
                                    own guide at the end of the decade. However, by the end of 2007 and mid of 2008, the food prices skyrocket
                                    and FAO's countries members started questioning the role of the Organization to control the rising in prices.

                                    The USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion published a new diagram for Americans. 
                                    It is a simple circle divided into five groups: Vegetables, Fruits, Protein, Grains and Dairy.

                                    This was the introduction to the MyPlate, which replaced the previous representation (MyPyramid) 
                                    which was considered confusing for many consumers and it was not well accepted. 
                                    This new diagram ended 19 years of food pyramid iconography in the country.

                                The actual concern regarding to Dietary Guidelines is its relationship with sustainability. 
                                Not only nutrition and environment, but also the economic and socio-cultural impacts. 
                                This approach has been increasingly debated and countries have started to incorporate 
                                sustainability in their food polices and education programs.

                                The new recommendation is to motive the countries to recommend seasonal and local foods, the 
                                reduction of waste, red and processed meat, as well as highly processed foods and added-sugar-beverages.
